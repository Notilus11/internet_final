i want to make a website that is a menu to different little projects, all in html/css/js, first i'd like that you make the menu, a minesweeper game and a unit converter, accessible from said menu. could you get started on that ?

I have a project that currently consists of a Main Menu, a Minesweeper game, and a Unit Converter. I want to add a third project to this: a Real-Time Chat Room using WebSockets. Can you generate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a basic chat interface, and provide the Node.js code for a server.js that can handle the WebSocket connections?

The code you provided works, but I want to keep my project clean. Please move all the chat-related files (index.html, style.css, functions.js) into their own folder named chat/. Then, update the server.js so it knows how to serve these files from that specific folder instead of the root.

I tried running the server with the files in the chat/ folder, but I'm getting an error. When I open the chat page, the console gives me a GET http://localhost:8081/chat/functions.js 404 (Not Found) error. It seems server.js is looking for the files in the wrong place. Can you fix the fs.readFile path logic in the server code to handle this subfolder correctly?

Okay, the chat works now! However, once I enter the chat room, I'm stuck there. I need a way to return to my main project menu. Can you update the chat's index.html to include a 'Back to Menu' link or button in the top navigation bar that points to ../main_index.html?

The chat is functioning, but when I look at the browser console, I see a bunch of red errors about chrome-extension://... and a warning about Tailwind CSS not being for production. Did you break something in the code, or can I ignore these? If they are safe to ignore, please explain why.

Please make the chat room look similar to the theme of the rest of the website!

We want to extend the unit converter in this project to also be a currency converter. To get the live currency rates use a api


AI-Assisted Development Workflow
1. Creation
Initial generation of core features and code.
Prompt: "I want to make a website that is a menu to different little projects, all in html/css/js, first i'd like that you make the menu, a minesweeper game and a unit converter, accessible from said menu. could you get started on that?"
2. Expansion
Adding features, scaling the architecture and adding complexity.
Prompt: “I have a project that currently consists of a Main Menu, a Minesweeper game, and a Unit Converter. I want to add a third project to this: a Real-Time Chat Room using WebSockets. Can you generate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a basic chat interface, and provide the Node.js code for a server.js that can handle the WebSocket connections?”
Prompt: "Please move all the chat-related files (index.html, style.css, functions.js) into their own folder named chat/."
Prompt: "Then, update the server.js so it knows how to serve these files from that specific folder instead of the root."
Prompt: "Update the server.js to log a timestamp to the console every time a user connects or disconnects from the chat room."

3. Organization
Identifying structural errors and misconfigurations.
Prompt: "I tried running the server with the files in the chat/ folder, but I'm getting this error: [error code]”
Prompt: "When I open the chat page, the console gives me a GET http://localhost:8081/chat/functions.js 404 (Not Found) error."

Prompt: "It seems server.js is looking for the files in the wrong place. I can’t find the error though can you explain it to me so I can avoid it in the future?"

4. Repair
Fixing bugs, broken paths, and implementing logic corrections.
Prompt: "Okay, the chat works now! However, once I enter the chat room, I'm stuck there. I can’t get back to the chat room selection!"
Prompt: "I need a way to return to my main project menu. From the chat room selection!"
Prompt: "Can you update the chat's index.html to include a 'Back to Menu' link or button in the top navigation bar that points to ../main_index.html?"
Prompt: "We want to extend the unit converter in this project to also be a currency converter."
Prompt: "To have real-time data of the currency exchange rates use a api"

5. Refinement
Polishing the UI, handling warnings, and styling.
Prompt: "The code you provided works, but I want to keep my project clean."
Prompt: "The chat is functioning, but when I look at the browser console, I see a bunch of red errors about chrome-extension://... and a warning about Tailwind CSS not being for production."
Prompt: "Did you break something in the code, or can I ignore these? [errors]"
Prompt: "If they are safe to ignore, please explain why."
Prompt: "Please make the chat room look similar to the theme of the rest of the website!"
